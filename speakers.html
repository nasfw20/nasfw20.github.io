                <span><b>Abstract:</b> In this talk I will present an overview of recent developments in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) also known as AutoDNN, a sub-field of AutoML. We will walk through key developments in the past few years and the rapid progress the community has made in this area where equivalent or better results can now be achieved on a single gpu machine in a day as opposed to thousands of gpu hours less than three years ago. I will end with our particular method, Efficient Forward Architecture Search (EFAS) which is particularly amenable for lifelong learning and real-world production environments. EFAS works by iteratively adding connections to existing network layers.<br>
                Finally we will see the large number of existing open problems including reproducibility and suitable benchmarking, that the community needs to address to achieve truly general solutions. Along the way we will highlight research opportunities in both theory and empirics.

                <span><b>Title: Representational Dissimilarity Analysis as a Tool for Neural Network Model Search</b></span><br><br>
                <span><b>Abstract:</b> Neuroscience theory posits that the brain’s visual system coarsely identifies broad object categories via neural activation patterns, with similar objects producing similar neural responses. Artificial neural networks also have internal activation behavior in response to stimuli. It can be hypothesized that networks exhibiting brain-like activation behavior will demonstrate brain-like characteristics, e.g., stronger generalization capabilities. This talk introduces a human-model similarity (HMS) metric, which quantifies the similarity of human fMRI and network activation behavior. To calculate HMS, representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) are created as abstractions of activation behavior, measured by the correlations of activations to stimulus pairs. HMS is then the correlation between the fMRI RDM and the neural network RDM across all stimulus pairs. The metric is tested on unsupervised predictive coding networks, which specifically model visual perception, and assessed for statistical significance over a large range of hyperparameters. The experiments show that networks with increased human-model similarity are correlated with better performance on two computer vision tasks: next frame prediction and object matching accuracy. Further, HMS identifies networks with high performance on both tasks. An unexpected secondary finding is that the metric can be employed during training as an early-stopping mechanism.

                <span><b>Title: Neural Architecture Search in Large-Scale 3D Medical Image Analysis</b></span><br><br>
                <span><b>Abstract:</b> Deep learning algorithms, in particular 2D and 3D fully convolutional networks (FCNs), have become the most popular methodology for volumetric medical image segmentation. In practice, 2D convolutions cannot fully leverage the spatial information, while 3D convolutions suffer from high GPU memory consumption. Moreover, it remains sophisticated and time-consuming to choose or design proper 3D networks given different tasks. In this talk, we introduce a novel approach to automatically search the network architecture tailoring to volumetric medical image segmentation. The entire searching strategy follows a coarse-to-fine fashion to automatically search a 3D segmentation network from scratch. Specifically, we divide the search procedure into two stages: 1) the coarse stage, where we search the macro-level topology of the network; 2) the fine stage, where we search at micro-level for operations in each cell between 2D, 3D or Pseudo-3D (P3D) convolutions at each layer. We evaluated our method on 10 public datasets from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge, which achieved state-of-the-art performance and proved the effectiveness and generalization of the search model.

                <span><b>Abstract:</b> In recent years automatically designing neural network architectures has become an increasingly popular research topic. In this talk I will go over a variety of advancements in the field of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) covering NAS being applied to a wide variety of different data domains ranging from image classification and video prediction to using NAS for tabular data. The talk will also cover different algorithms used in NAS and how they have improved greatly over time by using both gradient based and evolutionary strategies. These algorithmic improvements have allowed the computation required for NAS to decrease by orders of magnitude. Additionally, I connect the work on NAS to newer work that automatically designs data augmentation policies (AutoAugment) for various domains such as image classification and object detection. Finally I go over some very recent algorithmic improvements that greatly speedup the AutoAugment algorithm.
