                <span>Dr. Xia Hu is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University starting from Fall 2015, and is also a member of the Center for Remote Health Technologies and Systems and the Center for the Study of Digital Libraries. He is currently directing the DATA (Data Analytics at Texas A&M) Lab. His research involves developing automated and interpretable data mining and machine learning algorithms with theoretical properties to better discover actionable patterns from large-scale, networked, dynamic and sparse data. His research is directly motivated by, and contributes to, applications in social informatics, health informatics and information security. His lab’s work has been featured in Various News Media, such as MIT Tech Review, ACM TechNews, New Scientist, Fast Company, Economic Times. His research is generously supported by federal agencies such as DARPA (XAI, D3M and NGS2) and NSF (CAREER, III, SaTC, CRII, S&AS), and industrial sponsors such as Adobe, Apple, Alibaba and JP Morgan. He has several notable works in Automated Machine Learning published at venues such as KDD and ICDM. His lab developed the popular open source library called AutoKeras for automated machine learning. AutoKeras has over 6000 stars and around 1000 forks on GitHub.

                <span>Dr. Walter J. Scheirer is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of Notre Dame. His research is primarily focused around the problem of recognition, including the representations and algorithms supporting solutions to it. He is particularly interested in features and learning-based methods that apply to both vision and language. Specifically, his research revolves around open set recognition, extreme value theory models for visual recognition, biologically-inspired learning algorithms, and stylometry. One of his notable works is the CVPR 2019 paper “A Neurobiological Evaluation Metric for Neural Network Model Search". The paper takes a neurobiological approach towards assessing the statistical significance of a large range of hyperparameters of a neural network based on an fMRI-based human-model similarity metric.
